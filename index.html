            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I currently live in Los Angeles, Ca. I consider Los Angeles to be one of the best places to live in and I am very lucky to call it home. I have one daughter who means the world to me. In the past, I have owned different businesses that I started from the ground up, so I see myself a serial entreprenuer.
            </p>
            <p>
                I joined Delpick in February 2020 as an Executive Assistant, reporting directly to the CEO where I oversee internal reporting and manage strategic initiatives. I am also an investor and take on an active role in helping create the entity. I am a partner in the company and take part in creating innovtive ideas and I enjoy being a part of a great team with a vision of driven success. I believe that the e-commerce environment is growing at a faster pace and businesses will change even more than they have in the previous 50 years. I am excited about the future and being a part of a start-up where e-procurement is vital in purchasing everything.
