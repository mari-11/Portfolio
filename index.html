        <h2>Work:</h2>
        <section>I am the Chief Operating Officer at Delpick. I'm fortunate to work alongside Venturino Piccolo who is the CEO and Founder of Delpick. As a business partner at Delpick, I continually implement innovative ideas to enrich and grow the company. I am the first point of contact and meet with investors, advisors, entrepreneurs, vendors, service providers, and other collaborative networks.  Working at Delpick is a once in lifetime kind of journey. As a serial entrepreneur, I’ve started several businesses in the cities of Monterey, Seaside, and Los Angeles. However, working in a tech scalable business is my passion. Venturino is not only my business partner but he is also my mentor. The beginning process lies in the “soul” of a start-up. It is usually the case that early founders tend to have a deep connection and sense of presence like no other.

        <section>“Over the long term, a strong soul will draw in and fire up various stakeholders. Even as companies institute processes, discipline, and professionalization, they should strive to retain the spiritual trinity of business intent, customer connection, and employee experience. It’s the secret to not only growth but also greatness. ”   Ranjay Gulati
