        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I currently live in Los Angeles, Ca. I consider Los Angeles to be one
            of the best places to enjoy life and I am very lucky to call it home.
            I have one daughter who means the world to me. In the past, I have
            owned different businesses that I started from the ground up, so I see
            myself a serial entreprenuer.
